# Music-gerne-classification
3rd assignment for the Patern Recognition, Machine Learning (ΕΠ8 uoa) course

This is the first time I use Neural Networks. In this notebook, I start with a simple Feed Forward NN and then switch to a Convolutional NN. I was tasked with identifying the mysic gerne from 1 second music clips. This assignment was very helpful in understanding NNs and how tweeking the hyper parameters impacts the accuracy.
